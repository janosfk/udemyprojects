- expression evaluation -> substitution model (lambda calculus), can be applied to expressions
	if they don't have side effects
	- evaluaton: reduce expression to value
- evaluation strategies
	- call by value: every function arg is evaluated once
	- call by name: a function arg is not evaluated at all, if param is not used in function body
- scala normally uses call-by-value
- Newtons method
